# Prime-Padovan-Sequence-Coding-Joy

The Padovan Sequence is a special type of sequence in which the nâ€™th term is determined by the recurrence relation;
P(n)=P(n-2)+P(n-3)
Where P(0),P(1) and P(2) are initialized to 1.

The task at hand is to generate prime padovan sequence till a number; to display only those terms occurring before the limit which are prime as well as a part of the padovan sequence.
